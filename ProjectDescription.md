# Text Generation With LSTM

This project demonstrates how to build a small Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to generate text. The example uses the text from "Alice in Wonderland." The notebook includes steps for loading and preprocessing the text data, mapping characters to integers, and building an LSTM model with Keras. The goal is to generate new text sequences based on the patterns learned from the original text.
